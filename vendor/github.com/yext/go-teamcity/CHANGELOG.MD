## [0.5.1]

### Added

- Add support for `octopus.push.package` step. It allows creating and pushing packages from [TeamCity to Octopus](https://octopus.com/docs/api-and-integration/teamcity). [#53]

### Fixed
- Issue with serialization and newlines for VCSRoot branchSpec property

### Changed

- (**BREAKING CHANGE**) Move package code from `pkg/teamcity` to `teamcity`.
  - The former structure caused some issues with tooling such as `gocode` and `godef`.
  Since this project follows [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github) design and conventions, I've adapted the project structure as well.
